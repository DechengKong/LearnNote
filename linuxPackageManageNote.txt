### Bulid local resource server
step1: Mount CD
    command:    mkdir /mnt/cdrom ; mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom/
    command:    mkdir /mnt/my_iso ; mount ~/Download/centos.iso -o loop /mnt/my_iso/
step2: Lost the network Yum resource
    command:    mv /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo.bak
step3: Config CentOS-Media.repo
    command:    vim /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Media.repo
                baseurl=file:///mnt/cdrom

### Source Code Install
Prepare: make clean (if the source contains the last compiled target file(*.o) )
1. configure
 -----Check the environment's software properties, generate the 'Makefile' file
2. make
 -----make compiles according to the instructions of Makefile and uses gcc to compile the source code into a target file. 
      These target files are linked through the function library to generate a complete executable file. At this point this
      runnable file has not been installed to the directory where it is scheduled to be installed, still under the current compilation directory.
3. make install
 -----Install the files compiled in the previous step into a assigned directory
